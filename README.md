"# Cipher-School" 
# Java Certification Project

This repository contains the projects and exercises I completed as part of my Java certification from Cipher School. The repository demonstrates my understanding of Java programming concepts and my ability to write efficient and robust code.

## Features of Java Practiced:
- **Core Java Concepts**: Variables, data types, operators, and control structures.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Collections Framework**: Lists, Sets, Maps, and iterators.
- **Exception Handling**: Writing safe and error-tolerant programs.
- **File Handling**: Reading and writing files in Java.
- **Multithreading**: Basics of concurrent programming in Java.
- **Java 8 Features**: Streams, lambda expressions, and functional programming.

## Projects and Assignments
- Completed all exercises provided by Cipher School as part of the certification.
- Worked on hands-on projects that tested real-world Java applications.

## How to Use the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/DrSkyRitik-15/Cipher-School>
   ```
2. Open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
3. Ensure that JDK 8 or higher is installed and configured.
4. Build and run individual projects to see the implemented features.

## Certification Details
